    "This course, EECE.4510/5510, covers the fundamentals of Heterogenous Computing and practical programming skills on SYCL/DPC++ programming in oneAPI framework. SYCL Programming for Heterogenous Computing can target different types of accelerator devices like CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs across any vendor. We will use this set of lab assignments to help you learn the concepts, tools and methodology for developing heterogeneous computing applications. The lab assignments are to be completed on Intel Developer Cloud, to which Intel Corporation generously provides free access for the students taking this course at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- SYCL is open standard, cross-architecture and cross-vendor programming solution to High Performance Computing.\n",
    "- SYCL enables heterogenous computing and code reuse across architectures (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) and across vendors.\n",
    "- SYCL breaks the Chains of Proprietary Lock-in and gives freedom to make your best choice, choose the best accelerated technology the software doesn’t decide for you.\n",
    "- oneAPI aims to simlify software development and accelerate performance across a wide range of computing architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators.\n",
    "- DPC++ extends the standard C++ language with features that enable developers to write code that can execute in parallel on various types of hardware."

    "At the end of this course you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the challenges of Heterogenous Computing.\n",
    "- Write a SYCL program that offloads computation to accelerator devices like CPUs, GPUs or FPGAs from any vendor. \n",
    "- Understand how a SYCL program manages the data and the implications of various data management schemes.\n",
    "- Understand how a SYCL program express parallelism using kernels and the scheduling of kernels.\n",
    "- Understand how to break up a problem into bite-size chunks and group work-items to improve the performance of algorithms.\n",
    "- Perform analysis and profile the SYCL code using Intel oneAPI tools to find performance bottle necks. "
